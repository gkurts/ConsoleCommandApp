A very simple C# console app framework that uses the [Spectre.Console CommandApp](https://spectreconsole.net/cli/commandapp) implemention. This whole idea is to just use this as a starting point for new console apps.

Quite often, simple console apps grow in scale during project development and, sometimes, after. They end up needing to call multiple services and/or do multiple things. Using the Command pattern to do this makes the code very easy to maintain.
